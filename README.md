# Bookmarks

Bookmarks are saved views of the game board. This mod allows you to create six bookmarks on each game board. Bookmarks are unique among saves.

# Hot Keys

The 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 0 keys in the row above the letters provide six bookmarks. To set the bookmark, hit shift and then one of the listed number.

To jump to the bookmark, press the number without the shift.

# Configuration

## Set Meta Key
You can change the key used to set bookmarks to the control key. The option should be 
self-explanatory on the options screen.

(On macs running OSX, this might change the key to the command key. I have no way to test this.)

## Jump To Zero
When enabled, whenever a screen loads that you been to before, and created bookmarks for, if a "Zero" bookmark is already defined in the save game for that screen, the game will jump to bookmark.
